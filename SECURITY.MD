# Reporting Security Issues

Please report security issues and bugs privately by emailing security@duendesoftware.com. This will allow us to assess the risk and make a fix available before the issue is publicly disclosed. 

Please do not create public issues if you believe you have found a security problem.

Security reports will receive a response from Duende within two business days. 

Thanks!
